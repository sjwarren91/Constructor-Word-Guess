# Constructor-Word-Guess
A simple word guessing game where you have a certain amount of tries (in this case 10) to guess the word by guessing letters one after the other. This word guessing game is a recreation of my previous word guessing game however this one is a Command Line Interface application.

I am the sole contributer on this app.

## Technologies used
* Node.js - Used to run the scripts on the local machine.
* Inquirer.js package - Used to prompt the user for inputs at various stages of the game
* Constructors - Each word is a constructor made up of letter constructors. Remaking this game using constructors is a good way to introduce the concept of constructors to delve deeper into object oriented programming.
* Chalk.js package - used to beautify some of the plain command line GUI. 

## Other concepts used
To successfully create a CLI application word guessing game relying on the Inquirer.js package for repeated user input required knwoledge of function recursion. Where a function calls itself within itself until some predefine condition is met.
